    <li class="question">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? What are your impressions?</li>
<p class="answer">EDA teaching approach is completely new to me, as before I studied only in traditional schools and universities. My first impression is absolutely positive, and I am totally open to the new study technique.</p>
      <li  class="question">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
<p class="answer">No doubt, it will be fun to be a part of EDA culture :)</p>
  <li  class="question">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>

  <li  class="question">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
<p class="answer">I am very excited about EDA environment! Don't feel too nervous, as I know we will support each other! :)</p>
