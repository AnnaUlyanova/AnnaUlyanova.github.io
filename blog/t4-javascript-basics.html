    <li class="question">How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</li>
        <p class="answer">
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together on a background of a webpage, so browser know how to load the data. While HTML is a structure, CSS is a style, Javascript adds interactive elements to a webpage, and also makes a webpage to react on user's actions. So basically JS is able to change web page content or style in response to events coming from user's side.

      <li  class="question">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</li>
        <p class="answer">
          Javascript supports control flow statements, e.g. if, for, while. Example from real life: <u>IF today is Saturday</u>, THEN get up at 9am, otherwise get up at 7am. In this example <u>"if today is Saturday"</u> is a control flow statement.<br>
          Loops allows you to execute the same blosk of code a number of times. Example from real life: <u>WHILE baking bread</u>, set the temperature at 200 °C. It means that every time you are making bread, you know the temperature, and your cookbook doesn't need to repeat it every time for different bread recipes.
        </p>
  <li  class="question">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</li>
        <p class="answer">
          It is easier to explain the difference on the following examples: <br>
          <u>Accessing data from arrays</u>:<br>
          Array: var countries = ["Canada", "Japan", "Italy", "Vanuatu"];<br>
          To access data we use bracket [ ] notation and refer to index: countries [0] // returns "Canada". <br>
          <u>Object literals</u>:<br>
          Object: var giraffe = {name: "Melman", age: 10, height: 6, color: "yellow"}; <br>
          To access data we can use literal notation: giraffe.name // returns "Melman".
        </p>
<li  class="question">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li>
        <p class="answer">
          Function is a set of rule where we tell computer what to do. A function takes an input (an argument), does something with it and gives you back a result (an output). And later you can use this result in your code. You need to use functions to stick with one of the main programming rules: "Don't Repeat Yourself".
